Masoud Mansoury is an Assistant Professor in [Multimedia Computing Group (MMC)](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/multimedia-computing) at [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/), the Netherlands. Before joining TU Delft, he was a Postdoctoral researcher at [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLab)](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) at [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en) where he worked on interactive and online learning-to-rank recommendation models like those based on contextual bandits. Also, in this position, he was a memeber of [Elsevier Discovery Lab](https://discoverylab.ai/) where he worked on various aspects of the recommendation systems at [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/).

In 2021, Masoud obtained his PhD in Computer and Information Science at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/) under supervision of [Bamshad Mobasher](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/Faculty-and-Staff/pages/faculty-info.aspx?fid=653), [Robin Burke](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/college-leadership/robin-burke), and [Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/mykola-pechenizkiy). The topic of his PhD was on understanding and mitigating unfairness and algorithmic bias in recommender systems. In particular, he studied the negative impacts of unfair recommendation on different stakeholders in the system and proposed solutions to tackle them. He also completed his M.Sc. degree in Information Technology (IT) at [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/index.php?sid=1&slc_lang=en), Iran, where for his M.Sc. thesis he worked on the application of trust and reputation methods for improving the peroformance of recommender systems. Upon completion of his M.Sc. degree and prior to starting his PhD program, Masoud worked in industry for 5 years on various software engineering projects.

Masoud's broad research interests lie in the area of **Trustworthy and Explainable Recommender Systems**. More specifically, he conducts research on the following topics: **1) Algorithmic bias:** tackling bias issue in recommendation models to improve the business aspects and accuracy of the recommendation systems and mitigating the unfairness issue that may raise due to algorithmic bias, **2) Explainability and Transparency:** understanding the logic behind the recommendation process, explaining the factors causing/leading to the recommendation outputs, **3) Robustness:** detecting the malicious behavior and patterns in recommendation process to avoid unwanted manipulation of this process.


<span style='color:#FF0000;font-family:"bold"'>To prospective and self-motivated students: I have an open PhD position on Trustworthy Recommender Systems, covering fascinating topics such as explainability, robustness, bias and fairness in recommender systems. Deadline for submittin the application is July 25, 2024. For more information check the [vacancy page](https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/vacatures/details?jobId=17765)</span>
